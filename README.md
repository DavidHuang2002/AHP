While I was interning in 百融云创, I learned from my leader that in situation where data is lacking, the modeling for credit risk is often done by surveying experts and combine their opinions into a model using the Analytical Hierachy Process(AHP)
To have a better understanding of the AHP, I decide I will put it into code then apply it to my college-picking decision, hence this project
